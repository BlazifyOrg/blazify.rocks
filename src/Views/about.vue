  <Header title="About" description="What did we start out as? The founder (Romeah) Founded blazify originally as a private gaming team, from there we passed onto a team of developers working on a discord bot named blazify. Things weren't very smooth so the project was shut down when the bot was near around a hundred servers. From there we went to developing a discord library named evolvejs highly inspired by discord.JS. And now? Well yea things are just goin' on, we are developing a language."/>
